OPRS stands for “open source plastic recycling systems” and they allows people to use, study, change, and distribute the designs for to anyone and for any purpose.

This allows the development of  a community around sharing and improve plastic recycling solutions.

It is also perfect way to get started into processing local plastic recycling and educating people.
